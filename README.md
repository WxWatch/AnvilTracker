### AnvilTracker

A (currently very basic) system for tracking 3D Printing filaments, and your prints.
Designed for tracking used filaments, remaining amounts, total materials costs 
and sold profits (optionally) in place of my bulky, complicated, and cumbersome
spreadsheet I've been using. :)

I wish there was some witty story behind the branding of the name, but quite simply
I refer to my 3D Printing business as Voxel Forge, and figured something about Anvils
made sense!

## Current features:
 - Enter and track each physical spool of filament and it's metrics.
 - Enter and track each print you run.
 - Track filament consumed per spool pased on prints.
 - Basic user authentication for general security.
 
## Future plans:
 - Reporting system for reports on time and materials cost/profits
 - Tagging for prints for more detailed reporting.
 - Additional tracking of filament materials for logging of optimal settings
 - A much better UI for great sexiness
